# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

This project is a password generator that can create a randomized password between 8 and 128 characters and determined by criteria the user inputs when prompted. 
The motivation behind this project was to practice my if statements, and also learn how to build a for loop. 
I learned that this project could have been tackled in many different ways, and how versatile JavaScript is as a language.  I chose to use arrays to build my project,
but see how strings and the use of Substring could be used to get the same outcome.
